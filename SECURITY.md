# Privacy Policy for Simple Note

## Introduction
Simple Note is a Chrome extension designed to help users store personal notes locally on their device. This privacy policy outlines how we handle and protect your data. The extension does not transmit data to external servers or share any information with third parties.

## Data Collection
Simple Note stores the information users input directly within their browser’s local cache. The extension does not collect personal or sensitive data beyond what users enter in their notes. No data is transmitted to external servers.

## Data Usage
The data stored by Simple Note is used solely for the purpose of allowing users to save and access their personal notes within their browser. This data remains stored locally and is not used for any other purpose. We do not use or process this data for analytics, advertising, or any other external activity.

## Data Sharing
Simple Note does not share any user data with third parties. The information remains locally on the user's device and is not transmitted over the internet. We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties.

## Data Security
User data is stored locally within the browser's local cache. The security of this data depends on the user’s own browser and device security settings. While we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of data stored on your device, as it is subject to the security settings and conditions of the device and browser used.

## User Control
Users can manage their data by clearing their browser’s cache or deleting individual notes from within the Simple Note interface. Once the data is deleted, it cannot be recovered. Users can also uninstall the extension, which will remove any locally stored data.

### Note Export Feature
Simple Note includes an export feature that allows users to save their notes as files on their local device. When users export their notes, the data is saved directly on their device and is not shared or transmitted elsewhere. Users are responsible for managing and securing exported files, as they are saved outside of the browser's local cache and may be subject to different security risks depending on where the files are stored.

## Changes to Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. We encourage users to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting their data.
